  Trunk package now supports installing for windows, via the newer trunk npm based install, while maintaining the bash install for linux/darwin.
  If the project has a package.json, then it will install as dev dependency, otherwise as a global tool.
  No logic to detect alternative tooling such as yarn, bun, deno, etc unless requested.
  While trunk also supports this method of installation for Darwin/Linux, I've opted to keep it the same as before and use the bash install method for those regardless if package.json is there or not.
