kind: Removed
body: Removed much of the tooling for toolist that is non-critical. Most tools now
  use self resolving binary install so that initialization is not required. For other
  gopls VSCode handles, and Aqua is a great way to also install with a much faster
  processing time as it doesn't install from source, but instead uses binary release
  downloads.
