## v0.0.14 - 2022-10-17

### Changed

- Disabled `licensing` module tests.
  It's too problematic with output when non-go code is found.
  This licensing module will likely be deprecated soon as well as better solutions out there with renovate, fossa, synk, and others.
- Resolved devcontainer configuration breaking with newer devcontainer configuration.
  Also improved handling of arguments, loading, and aqua initialization.
  This is is primarily impactful to any devcontainer based development, and not significant to any usage of the library itself.

### Deprecated

- Licensing package (no uses noted on github), gittools, docker.devcontainer commands.
  These all are not used or minimal impact.
  Once removed I'll bump the main version of the magetools to allow for better upgrade path and avoid impacting any current uses.

### Removed

- Removed much of the tooling for toolist that is non-critical.
  Most tools now use self resolving binary install so that initialization is not required.
  For other gopls VSCode handles, and Aqua is a great way to also install with a much faster processing time as it doesn't install from source, but instead uses binary release downloads.
